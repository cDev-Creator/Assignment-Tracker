# Assignment-Tracker
I created this application to track my weekly university assignments. Going back and forth on blackboard can be a hassle but using my Workflow manger makes it very easy to easily keep track of all my classes. I also recently included a pomodoro timer to remind myself to stand up and takes breaks while working on my weekly assignments as well as when I am coding. <br>
